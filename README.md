# Repository Purged — Remediation Protocol

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Authority:** webwaka007 (Founder)
**Protocol:** REMEDIATION-01

## Status: AWAITING LEGITIMATE RE-EXECUTION

This repository has been **purged** as part of the Organelle-Universe Remediation Plan.

### Reason for Purge

A deep audit conducted on 2026-02-27 revealed that this repository contained only **template-level code** that was generated as part of an illegitimate batch closure of organelle-universe issues. The code did not represent real, phase-by-phase work as mandated by the 7-Phase Lifecycle and 8-Step Execution Protocol.

Specific violations found:
- **Zero test files** — P3 (Testing) and P4 (Verification) phases were rubber-stamped
- **Only 1-2 commits** — Expected multi-phase commit history was absent
- **Template-identical structures** — Code was batch-generated, not individually crafted
- **Agent protocol violations** — Issues were closed by agents different from those assigned

### What Happens Next

This organelle will be re-executed from scratch following the full protocol:
- P0: Specification (3 tasks with real deliverables)
- P1: Design (3 tasks with real deliverables)
- P2: Implementation (3 tasks with real deliverables)
- P3: Testing (3 tasks with real test suites)
- P4: Integration/Verification (3 tasks with real verification)
- P5: Documentation/Deployment (3 tasks with real documentation)
- P6: Ratification (3 tasks with real ratification artifacts)

Each task will be executed by the assigned agent using the correct PAT, with real commits pushed to this repository.
